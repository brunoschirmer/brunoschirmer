## Data Science Projects:

### [Rossmman Stores Sales]( https://github.com/brunoschirmer/rossman_stores )

The hypothetical commercial context that guides the project is basically to meet the request made by the CFO to the managers of each store. The request consisted of the revenue forecasts of the stores for the next six weeks because he wanted to reform the stores and wanted based on the amount of sales after six weeks of the store.


### [Health Insurance Cross-Sell]( https://github.com/brunoschirmer/health_insurance_cross_sell ) 

This project aimed to order a potential client list by propensity score, decreasing the cost with calls by reaching to the clients with the highest potential to buy the insurance.
